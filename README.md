# Call Quality Intelligence Dashboard  
A Frontend-Only Telecom Analytics Platform (No Backend)

The **Call Quality Intelligence Dashboard** is a fully interactive, frontend-only web application that simulates real-time telecom network performance analytics. It visualizes key call-quality metrics, tower performance, jitter/latency trends, and includes an interactive call-scenario simulator with AI-style insights — all powered by static JSON datasets.

Designed for telecom environments like **Bell Mobility**, the project demonstrates strong frontend engineering, UI/UX design, data visualization, state management, and simulated intelligence without using any backend services.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Real-Time Call Performance Overview
Interactive metric cards displaying:
- Call Success Rate  
- Dropped Call Rate  
- Average Setup Time  
- MOS (Mean Opinion Score)  
- Network Jitter  
- Latency  

Each card includes:
- Trend indicators  
- Status colors  
- Subtle micro-interactions  

---

### 2. Tower Performance Map
A visual grid/map of simulated Canadian cell towers:
- Toronto  
- Montreal  
- Vancouver  
- Calgary  
- Ottawa  
- Halifax  

Includes:
- Status indicators (Low / Medium / High / Critical)  
- Click-to-inspect tower details  
- Historical MOS score chart  
- Congestion and utilization info  

---

### 3. Call Quality Timeline
Dynamic time-series visualizations:
- MOS score over time  
- Jitter and latency comparison chart  
- Threshold markers  

With **AI-style Insights**:
- High jitter detection  
- Elevated drop rate  
- Congestion alerts  
- Recommendations for stability  

These insights are generated by rule-based logic on the client side.

### 4. Call Scenario Simulator
Users configure:
- Location  
- Time of day  
- Device type  
- Connection type (5G / LTE / VoLTE / Wi-Fi Calling)  

The dashboard predicts:
- Expected MOS score  
- Latency & jitter  
- Reliability rating  
- Risk severity  
- Recommended action  

All computed using a custom scoring engine entirely in the frontend.
